0:00:00 -> 0:00:30: I built a massive isolation chamber. And we're gonna see if these two strangers can survive in this chamber for the next 100 days. They have never met each other ever. Bailey, this is Susie. Susie, this is Bailey. Nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you. If the two of you can survive the next 100 days in here, I will give you the half a million dollars inside of this vault. But if one of you leaves before the 100 days is up, you both get nothing.
166 days, 16:00:00 -> 166 days, 16:00:30: Have fun. Okay, bye. This is gonna be crazy. Um, yeah. This is actually like an insane asylum. They're currently looking at all the stuff we put in there. We gave them enough food for 100 days. Which is healthy, but basically the exact same thing over and over again. We also gave them their own private bathroom, which comes with a shower, and obviously has no cameras inside. And a bed to sleep on. They have everything they need to survive 100 days.
333 days, 8:00:00 -> 333 days, 8:00:30: What do they want it? I got a comb. I don't know if I've ever combed my hair in my life. Interesting. See how they're both standing on different sides of the room? They're so awkward. When I had them take their blindfolds off, that was legitimately the first time they had ever met. I just keep thinking of the feeling of exotic. Oh yeah. How good is that gonna feel? It's only 100 sleeps. Only 100 sleeps.
500 days, 0:00:00 -> 500 days, 0:00:30: That's like what freaks me out. The most interesting part of this experiment is that in this room you have no idea what day or time it is. And already on night one, Suzy and Bailey made the mistake of only sleeping for two hours. Which means they started their second day at 2.37am. I'm just gonna act like this is just the new normal. Okay, what do you want to eat? Are you feeling beef or chicken? Chicken. Chicken sounds great.
666 days, 16:00:00 -> 666 days, 16:00:30: It's good. As you can see, living inside a white cube is pretty boring. Besides eating the same thing over and over, time in the chamber consisted of two things. Trying to hide from the bright lights. The lights are just so bright that we have to make these things to shield ourselves. And desperate attempts to keep themselves entertained. Like on day four when they used a paper from their journals to make a deck of playing cards. Is he making cards?
833 days, 8:00:00 -> 833 days, 8:00:30: I think that they actually came out alright. Which honestly looked pretty fun. So I made myself a $30,000 seat and joined in. On day five they made a sign in sheet, which was really just an elaborate trip. What is this? You have to sign our sign in sheet. Oh these are our camera people. Yeah, this is everyone that's come in today. Wait a minute. You're having them do this so you can track the date. And the time. Hold up, I need to borrow this. No, no, no, I wrote the date. I wrote the date.
1000 days, 0:00:00 -> 1000 days, 0:00:30: pretty smart. But by the time we got to day seven, anything considered smart was thrown out the window. Bailey's lost it. He's whipping the pork. Yeah, I bet he's missed a chance. Five more throws, but I only need one. Let's freaking go, baby. It's actually crazy to me that already on day nine of this challenge, they're bored enough to expose the red line. That if they cross, they lose every dollar of
1166 days, 16:00:00 -> 1166 days, 16:00:30: It is now day number 10. How you doing Nolan? Good. And I got a pretty interesting offer. What is this horse over there? So it looks like they took the $500,000 and put $250 on her side and $250 on his. To remind themselves of what's at stake. This, the whole door opening thing is so dramatic. How's it going? We're about to reveal the most interesting part of the challenge. I need you two to just face this wall. They don't even know that there's a door back here.
1333 days, 8:00:00 -> 1333 days, 8:00:30: This is our first time seeing the outside world in ten years. You are kidding me. The sky! Every ten days, I will give you something that will make the challenge easier. But if you actually want it, you'll have to pay for it with some of your prize money. And first, for day ten, we're going to give you the option to buy a private chef that will cook you whatever you want between now and the end of the challenge for $50,000.
1500 days, 0:00:00 -> 1500 days, 0:00:30: to let you have a nice meal. Use this as a floor for your imagination as to what you could be eating for 90 more days. You are kidding me. 50 grand a lot though. Let's not think about it right now. These look like some people that have only eaten canned chicken for 10 days. I love just looking at the sky. You forget that they literally haven't seen the sun in 10 days. Now I feel bad. After eating this, the thought of that food is like grossing me out even worse. It's rough. They're starting to talk about whether they should take it. I don't know what to do.
1666 days, 16:00:00 -> 1666 days, 16:00:30: This is a good first one to tempt us with. Oh no! Hey Jimmy! Alright, it's time for the decision. Would you pay $50,000 to have this for the rest of the challenge? Nope. I think we decided no. Really? I honestly didn't think you guys would say no. No, no, no, no! Oh my gosh. I have another offer in 10 days. We'll see if you cave in. I really thought you were going to say yes. Mm-mm. That was crazy. Bye. I'm really curious about what the next temptation is though. I know.
1833 days, 8:00:00 -> 1833 days, 8:00:30: I'm proud of us for staying strong. Good job. And now with the chef gone, it seemed like Susie and Bailey were already starting to regret their decision. Bon appetit. My favorite part is that you can hold it sideways, and then it stays on the plate. The next few days were pretty mind numbing for the both of them. Their routine consisted of waking up, cooking food, and then eventually just going back to sleep. Man, the longer I'm in here, the more I feel like I'm sharing a space with an annoying sibling. You're talking about me? Who else?
2000 days, 0:00:00 -> 2000 days, 0:00:30: getting used to each other, one thing they weren't getting used to were the constant beaming light. It's just so bright in there. I came to the bathroom because the light, you can keep it off so it's nice and dark in here. Once it gets super late at night, I physically feel my eyes stinging just because of how bright the lights are in here. And because it was so hard for them to get any sleep, I had the perfect offer planned for day 20. Congrats, you're 20% done. Are you two ready for the offer?
2166 days, 16:00:00 -> 2166 days, 16:00:30: Your day 20 offer is simple. I will give you each a smart bed that are super comfortable and combined will cost $50,000 of your prize money. I will also give you this iPad with the ability to turn off the lights. Dang. They have exactly one hour to decide if they want to spend $50,000 of their prize money for these beds and the ability to turn off the lights. The answer might be yes. I haven't seen Suzy this happy since we literally started the challenge. Let's remember what we would have to live with if we don't say yes. Oh my gosh.
2333 days, 8:00:00 -> 2333 days, 8:00:30: Oh my gosh. I think they're going to take it. I think we should. It's only 10% of our money. It's decision time. You're one hour up. This is what your eyeballs could have. But if you say no, this is what you're stuck with. For 80 days straight, do you want these comfortable beds? I'm actually OK with whatever you say. Five, four, three, two, one. What's your decision?
2500 days, 0:00:00 -> 2500 days, 0:00:30: No. Really? Okay, well I did not see that one coming. I think I made a mistake maybe. Oh what a heavy mistake. I cannot believe you guys said no. I'll leave you alone for a couple of days. I hope you don't regret your decision. Bye. Bye. I think we made the right decision. I can't believe that in the heat of the moment you said no. Oh I feel that slight regret right now. I don't. I feel no
2666 days, 16:00:00 -> 2666 days, 16:00:30: So today I made my calendar and I was just writing my mom's birthday. It's gonna be tough on that day I think. I'm so bored. I think that we're hitting a point where boredom is at like the all-time high. I woke up this morning and didn't feel like doing anything so I just sat there and stared. What are you gonna do with this money?
2833 days, 8:00:00 -> 2833 days, 8:00:30: I was probably gonna pay a lot on the house. Oh, that's awesome. I wanna pay off my parents' debt. That would be like my ideal world. Throughout the following days, I made sure to not interrupt the routine. However, I was also taking note of things they missed from the outside world. Like on day 24, when I overheard them wanting seasoning on their food. Okay, if we had seasoning, I could easily stay here 100 days. On day 27, Suzy was craving coffee. I am a big coffee drinker and LA of water.
3000 days, 0:00:00 -> 3000 days, 0:00:30: Bailey clearly needed entertainment. Doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-do
3166 days, 16:00:00 -> 3166 days, 16:00:30: Just let me know what you want. I'm so nervous. This is a big decision. Coffee. Ooh, it does sound kinda nice. It does. And then the seasoning. Seasoning sounds nice too. I'm doing this one 1000%, I'll be honest with you. I don't really care about that. Sick. Coffee would be nice. There's like a treat every morning. I've made my mind up. Decision time. Are you buying Monopoly? No. God. No. Are you buying the spices? No. No. No. Are you buying the coffee?
3333 days, 8:00:00 -> 3333 days, 8:00:30: with cream or sugar. If you say yes in three seconds. Yes. Okay. Yay! Are you buying the Harry Potter book? Yes. Are you buying the phone calls? No. No. We finally got you two to buy something. This feels good. Most pleasure doing business. Thanks for taking your money. Most expensive coffee maker in the world. 30 days in, we got something new. That's exciting. We caved, you're welcome. That's my closet. That's my bookshelf.
3500 days, 0:00:00 -> 3500 days, 0:00:30: Another 70 days easy. And we still have $480,000. That's crazy. Over the next few days, not a lot happened. She's already preparing a meal. It's like being married. The most interesting thing was when Hurricane Idaulia took out the power on day 34. Oh, no way. No way. As you can imagine, our cameras became pretty useless. So I'm just gonna take you to day 39. How's it going? Hello. Hi. Hey, I know you guys have been struggling. I'm sorry it took so long.
3666 days, 16:00:00 -> 3666 days, 16:00:30: Oh, there we go! That was a long delay. You should be able to use your coffee pot again, cook food, you should have hot shower. That's excellent. I'll see you tomorrow with a surprise. Oh, I'm so excited. Yay! The power's on! Look, it's lighting! Feels like cheerier. The lights are back on again. I just had a hot meal, hot shower. Life is finally looking up here. It is now day 40. Can I come in? Come in!
3833 days, 8:00:00 -> 3833 days, 8:00:30: This TV. But every single movie is $10,000 to pop. You have one hour to decide. Have fun. This is crazy, the amount of movies in here. We can watch this documentary about Nolan. Yeah, you can watch it. We left Suzy and Bailey to discuss the offer and told them we'd be back later, but they didn't seem too interested. How about 10 grand for all? I'll go ahead and tell you now. Now. You might as well just come in here because I think we both are set in our ways. Okay, the best I could do is buy one, get one half off.
4000 days, 0:00:00 -> 4000 days, 0:00:30: I can't do it. All right gang, come on in. Take every last one. I'll gladly keep this. Oh, not any of the Hunger Games? I left the TV in the chamber to remind Susie and Bailey of what they could have had, but little did I know they were gonna outsmart me. An antenna's just a piece of metal. Rip this little wire off the wall. So I had to take this knife so that the wire is frayed. I literally just plugged it into the antenna spot. Now we're gonna see if it works. Just anything, give us one channel. Oh!
4166 days, 16:00:00 -> 4166 days, 16:00:30: It says that there's seven digital channels. Oh my gosh. If this actually works... Wait, I'm like actually shaking. Bailey! Apparently the only thing we can get on the TV is a race car race. I've never really been a fan. Oh, he's in second! But today, all of a sudden, we're huge race car fans. Our time is gonna fly by. And Suzy was right, because for the next six days, that's all they did.
4333 days, 8:00:00 -> 4333 days, 8:00:30: It's like almost normal life. It is my mom's birthday tomorrow. Even though I won't be able to spend the day with her, I got some time in here to make her a little birthday present. Although I didn't go out and buy something, I'm technically spending money on it. Tomorrow is day 50, so I'm gonna use toilet paper to do streamers and decorate the room. It's day 50. Oh. Oh, hey. So what do you think your surprise is today?
4500 days, 0:00:00 -> 4500 days, 0:00:30: This one is a very big one. Alright, so the offer for day 50 is $20,000 for the both of you to see your families. They're in the other room watching that feed and they can hear everything we're saying. Hey, I miss you guys. Hi, I love you guys. I love you guys. I'll be back in 10 minutes to hear if you're gonna take the offer. Good luck, 10 minutes. This feels like a pretty easy decision. What are your thoughts? Oh my gosh, I don't know. This might be the only chance in this challenge to see them until the end. I think it's a no brainer personally. So it's up to you if we spend 20 grand for both. Of course, I wanna see my parents too.
4666 days, 16:00:00 -> 4666 days, 16:00:30: He's a yes and she's a no. Mom, dad, tell me what to do. All right, what are you thinking? Where are you guys at? He's been a yes from the beginning. As soon as you said it. About 10 seconds left. But it's my mom's birthday today and we're saying yes. All right, give me $20,000 and I'll go get them. Best 10K ever spent, I think. Okay, they've paid the 20 grand. Come on in. I'm so excited. Yay!
4833 days, 8:00:00 -> 4833 days, 8:00:30: And to celebrate her birthday, we brought a birthday cake. Oh! Yes. This is the best tasty thing they've had in forever. It's little things like that that you don't realize you won't have until you're in it. Bye! Love you! Bye! That's the worst feeling so far. The highest of highs, and now back to our little cube all alone. Like I said earlier, the things we're offering them are based off of what we're overhearing
5000 days, 0:00:00 -> 5000 days, 0:00:30: So you better believe that when Suzy said this, Probably the only thing I'd say yes to at this point is like if they do Tesla. You already know on day 60 I knew exactly what to surprise them with. How's it going? Hi! Oh hey, first things first, I brought you a giant mystery gift. Yay. Do the two of you want to spend $50,000 to keep what's inside of this box? Hmm. Is either gonna be the best moment of their life or the worst moment? Just give me your answer in an hour. Alright, thanks. We'll be thinking. 59 minutes remain. I think we should.
5166 days, 16:00:00 -> 5166 days, 16:00:30: It might be worth it. Imagine it is something great and we said no. Would it ever be a car? Well, it could be. It could actually be the keys to a car. It's not gonna be equal to the value that we're spending. She's right. It's almost three times more. I don't feel confident in the yes. Then let's say no. But are you sure? Yeah, if you're not confident. I just know they would never do a car. Yeah, they would. Really? I feel like they could do anything. Let's just say no. Wait, now you have me wondering if I say yes. Ah. Decision time. Okay.
5333 days, 8:00:00 -> 5333 days, 8:00:30: $50,000 to keep what's inside this box. Yes or no? No. Really? What is your answer? I'm going with no. Really? Yeah. I can't believe you guys didn't take it. Do you wanna unlock it? Sure. All right, inside is $50,000, so you would've got your money back. And then you wanna open up that stack of money, just grab that. Here is a Tesla key for you, and a Tesla key for you.
5500 days, 0:00:00 -> 5500 days, 0:00:30: They would have gotten their money back plus these two Teslas for free. Oh, I want to cry. I want to close this. That's literally my dream. We're gonna head out. You can leave their beef, thank you. Bye. That's wild. Bailey! They got us Teslas! I feel like we made the wrong decision. I'll regret this forever. Nah. Yeah, I will. Oh no, it's all a dream. Nah. I like my Prius.
5666 days, 16:00:00 -> 5666 days, 16:00:30: There I said it. And after getting hit hard by yesterday's offer, Suzy literally whined about the Tesla for nine days straight. It's really hard to see the positive in all this. I like actually won't be able to sleep. I'm actually feeling sick right now. I'm so mad. Suzy's taking it hard. And so to make up for it, I made sure this next offer was the best one yet.
5833 days, 8:00:00 -> 5833 days, 8:00:30: day 80 you're gonna be like there's only 20 days left and on day 90 you're gonna be like why would we spend money there's 10 days left correct? Yeah. Let me just open the doors. Oh god. No shot you reject this offer. What you see here is Everything you said no to so far in this challenge before I tell them the price tag I'm gonna move everything in here I'm gonna make it as easy as possible for them to say yes. Nolan, Chris put those by the TV. As much as I love to bully Nolan, he's just dumb
6000 days, 0:00:00 -> 6000 days, 0:00:30: That's a good price. What you are considering buying is these two $30,000 beds, a brand new mystery box. This one doesn't have 50 grand inside, it has something else. Sounds like 25 grand. One phone call each, spices monopoly. Every single movie in the Walmart will be on. And lastly, the cook you said no to. Oh, there is a plate of food. I see a lot of good food. And to remind you how good it is, here's some chicken Alfredo. That looks so good. It's time to find out how much this will cost you.
6166 days, 16:00:00 -> 6166 days, 16:00:30: Behind these curtains is a number. If you bid higher than that number, you get everything here for the rest of the challenge. But if you say one dollar, one penny lower, you get nothing. I'll give you an hour to figure out your bid. I'm thinking, what if it's like way low and they want us to say 150 grand? I think if we bid 75, that would be too little. They're thinking at least 100k. I actually feel like we should go a little bit lower because we were prepared to say no to it. That's true, but are you prepared to walk away with nothing? And while they're deciding what to do,
6333 days, 8:00:00 -> 6333 days, 8:00:30: The Shop app is the best way to shop on your phone, and it's completely free. It'll basically look at everything you're interested in and recommend you products you love. This is the only wild card because we know what beds are and we know what movies are. We don't know what's in here. I have a feeling I want whatever's inside. It's actually a third contestant. Boom. And when you're ready to buy, you can speed through checkout using ShopPay. Let's do this. 80 grand, I want to want. Because it's day 70, I don't want to go under 70. I feel like this is like, gives us space.
6500 days, 0:00:00 -> 6500 days, 0:00:30: that was the reason why we didn't end up getting all this. I would be so sad. Shop app will even track all your packages in one place so you don't know exactly when they'll arrive for the holidays. $100,000 and $100. Yeah, it's not really that much damage. Okay, ready? Official, we're flipping it. I hope we get it. Let the shop app AI assistant scan hundreds of millions of products all over the shop app to recommend the perfect gifts for this holiday season.
6666 days, 16:00:00 -> 6666 days, 16:00:30: What's the number? Let me see it. Before you do, make sure you download the Shop app right now if you haven't already. I explained all the benefits of it. It's a beautiful amazing app. Download the Shop app. Okay, what is your bid? If it's one dollar below mine, you get nothing. 100,001 dollars. Chandler, reveal it. Sixty-nine. We did it! Yes! You overpaid by thirty- I don't care! We got the bag! Yo, this is the most excited I've been so far.
6833 days, 8:00:00 -> 6833 days, 8:00:30: This mystery box, which I did clarify was different, it's two smaller Teslas. No, I love this. I'll be teaming up with the Shop app to grant thousands of wishes this holiday season. I'll tell you more about it at the end of the video. Our room feels drastically different right now. It's a dream. We now have so many things to do. It's like a vacation. It's an investment for sure. I think it was well worth $100,000. You may think, oh, the challenge is over now, but one of them may lose everything. You'll see on day 99 what I'm talking about.
7000 days, 0:00:00 -> 7000 days, 0:00:30: Now you would think that getting all this stuff would make both of them a lot happier. But strangely enough, the opposite actually started to happen. One thing I took for granted on the outside was a hot shower that I also did not share with anyone. The hot water tank here runs out so quickly and Bailey always showers before me. So I've been stuck showering with cold water for honestly a couple months now.
7166 days, 16:00:00 -> 7166 days, 16:00:30: She uses to play. Like maybe she just hates board games. I think we need to take like three days and cram as many movies as we can. All she ever does is read or watch movies. We gotta have like a movie marathon. So whenever I'm like, can we just finish that game? She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it never ends up happening. It's impossible to get her to focus. Hey, do you wanna watch the notebook later? No, I don't wanna watch the notebook later. We just spent the last like 25 minutes trying to choose a movie. And Suzy, what did you say you're about to go do? Shower. Sorry.
7333 days, 8:00:00 -> 7333 days, 8:00:30: All the time. Bailey is wired right now. This happens literally every morning. He is just nonstop, so energetic all the time. I just had to come in here, because I can't go anywhere else. That's a rave right there. Bailey, it's 3 AM. Yeah, but sometimes you got to rave. Oh, get me out of here. Do the worst. Do you want to play Monopoly? Hmm, nah.
7500 days, 0:00:00 -> 7500 days, 0:00:30: Yeah. I hid them. Because you keep asking me to play, so I was like, maybe if I just hide them, then we'll never be able to play. Your toes look so long! No, that's sickening. My dogs are barking. Ew. I would like to be saved. Mom, I'm ready to leave.
7666 days, 16:00:00 -> 7666 days, 16:00:30: With the inn so close they set their differences aside and counted down the days. Four days left. Three. And Bailey, well... It's gonna be... Really couldn't wait to walk out those doors. I wasn't in the middle of saying anything. Alright, day 99. For me it feels like it's been honestly an entire year. I can't imagine what they're feeling. I have to brush my teeth one more time. Ever. Um... 24 hours remain! This many! Yes.
7833 days, 8:00:00 -> 7833 days, 8:00:30: So this is the first second of the challenge when you've walked in. Oh my gosh. How is that us? I feel like I'm looking like a fetus in that. Come on in gentlemen. Set it up right above the door. Oh this is so exciting. You officially have 24 hours left in the challenge. Don't forget what I said. We got a fun twist for tomorrow. I'm scared. Do you think they'll still be friends after this? Depends what their answer is tomorrow. I'm worried that it's going to be double or nothing. He's so like quiet about it.
8000 days, 0:00:00 -> 8000 days, 0:00:30: Yeah, and with their final night coming to an end it was time to present them with an opportunity to double their money Hey everyone This is chaotic. What is going on? I don't know Big boy, I want to help but not really they're literally just taking everything Do you know what these are those are our blindfolds from the first day that was quick I remember like it was yesterday if you would both please put them back on let's see if they want to double their money Okay
8166 days, 16:00:00 -> 8166 days, 16:00:30: I'm actually doing an OHS. A hundred days ago they were strangers. One hour ago they were best friends. Let's see if they become total enemies. Bailey and Suzy, take your blindfolds off. So, you might be familiar with what we're about to offer you. You each have the choice to split the money and nothing changes. You both hit split, you just split it, keep what you have. Or, if you hit steal, you can steal the other person's money. And if you both hit steal, you would get nothing.
8333 days, 8:00:00 -> 8333 days, 8:00:30: plugs in and noise cancellation headphones on top of them. She can't hear us. What's going through your head? I don't even like, no. Susie, if you put steal, I can't imagine. What do you say to somebody that steals 180 whatever? Maybe you get ahead of it and you steal it. There. You didn't hear that?
